# Beginner Level

1. Number Guessing Game
   - Write a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

2. Palindrome Check
   - Write a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
