# Interest Calculator

This Python script calculates the interest earned and the total payable amount based on the principal, interest rate, and time period.

# Introduction

The Interest Calculator is a simple Python program that computes the total interest earned on a principal amount over a given time period, using a specified interest rate. It also calculates the total amount payable (principal plus interest).

# How It Works

  1  Convert the rate: The given rate is divided by 100 to get its decimal equivalent.

  2  Calculate the increase factor: Multiply the rate by the number of years to get the overall percentage increase, then add 1 to compute the final multiplier.

  3  Compute total amount: Multiply the principal by this multiplier.

  4  Determine interest: Subtract the principal from the total amount to get the interest earned.

# Usage

To run the Interest Calculator:

  1  Ensure you have Python installed.

  2  Save the script into a file (e.g., interest_calculator.py).

  3  Run the file using the Python interpreter
