# Palindrome Checker in Python

  This Python script defines a simple function to check whether a given word is a palindrome.
  * What is a Palindrome?

  A palindrome is a word, number, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.
  Examples: madam, level, radar, jayaj.

# How It Works

  The function pal(word):

  Reverses the input word manually using a loop.

  Compares the reversed word with the original.

  Returns True if they match (i.e., it's a palindrome), otherwise returns False.

 # How to Run

  Copy the code into a .py file (e.g., palindrome.py)

  Run it using Python:

  ** this code demonstrates how to reverse a string manually, which is great for learning. **
