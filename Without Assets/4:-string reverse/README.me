# String Reverser (Manual Method)

This is a simple Python function that reverses a given string without using any built-in reverse functions or slicing techniques.
## 🧠 Purpose

To demonstrate basic string manipulation using loops, helping beginners understand how string reversal works internally.
## 📝 Function Definition

def sting(aa):
    ab = ''
    for i in aa:
        ab = i + ab
    print(ab)
    return ab

## 🚀 How It Works

    Initializes an empty string ab.

    Loops through each character i in the input string aa.

    Adds each character to the front of ab, effectively reversing the order.

    Prints and returns the reversed string.

## 💡 Example Usage

sting("jayendra")

## Output:

ardneyaJ

## ❌ Limitations

    Prints the reversed string even if you only want to return it (you may remove print() in production).

    Function name sting is likely a typo and should ideally be named reverse_string.
